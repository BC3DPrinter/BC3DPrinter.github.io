<h2><center>Instructions for Personal 3D Printing</center></h2>
<p>To make your own designs use <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com">Tinkercad</a>, you will need to make an account and go through the tutorial on how to use the website.</p>

<p>When you have completed the tutorial and created your first design that you would like print, click export then select .stl</p>

<p>Be sure to have installed the application <b><u>Pronterface</u></b> and <b><u>Slic3r</u></b> as this is the printing applications you will be using for personal printing. You can find these by using Google or off of the Makergear website.</p>

<p>Once you have the .stl file, add it to Slic3r and click arrange. If this is the first time using <b>Slic3r</b>, you will need to modify the settings of it so it will print correctly.</p>

<p>Under filament settings, you will need to change the diameter to 1.5mm</p>

<p>Under printer settings, you will need to change the nozzle diameter to 0.35mm</p>

<p>Once all setting have been configured, click export g-code and save the file to what you want.</p>

<p>Next, open Pronterface and connect the printer to the application by clicking connect.</p>

<p>Then, set the heat to 220 C and the bed to 70 C.</p>

<p>Once the temperature are where they are supposed to be click extrude and a thin line of filament should come out.</p>
